<p>It is clear that significantly more women than men <strong>attended</strong> evening classes at the education center. We can also see that evening courses <strong>were</strong> much more popular among older adults.</p>
<p><em><strong>Details - 2 paragraphs</strong></em></p>
<p>According to the bar chart, language, painting and drama courses attracted more women than men to the education center in 2009. Language classes had the highest number of participants overall, with 40 female and 20 male attendees, while painting was also a popular choice among both genders, attracting 30 female and 25 male students. The only course with a higher number males was sculpture, but this course was taken by a mere 15 people in total.</p>
<p>Looking at the age profile pie chart, we can see that the majority of people attending evening lessons were over 40 years of age. To be precise, 42% of them were aged 50 or more, and 26% were aged between 40 and 49. Younger adults were in the minority, with only 11% of students aged 20 to 29, and only 5% aged under 20.</p>

<p>The first flow diagram illustrates the process of glass container production, and the second  diagram shows steps in the process of recycling used glass.</p>
<p><em><strong>Overview - 2 sentences, 2 main points</strong></em></p>
<p>We can see that glass is made using three main raw materials, and that the manufacturing process consists of four distinct stages. It requires five steps to turn used glass into new glass products.</p>
<p><em><strong>Details - 2 paragraphs</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>At the first stage</strong> in glass production, sand, soda ash, limestone and other chemicals are mixed together. <strong>Next</strong>, the mixture is heated in a glass furnace at approximately 1500 degrees Celsius. The molten glass can <strong>then</strong> be shaped, by blowing, to create the end products, namely glass containers.</p>
<p>Glass recycling begins with the collection of used glass product. The collected glass is sorted according to its color, and then washed in order to remove any impurities. At the forth stage of recycling, the glass is crushed melted, and the resulting molten glass can finally be moulded to create new items. </p>

<p><strong>The two pictures compare the current layout of</strong> the ground floor of a house <strong>with</strong> <strong>a plan to redesign</strong> the same living space.</p>
<p><em><strong>Overview - 2 sentences, 2 main points</strong></em></p>
<p>（大厅消失了，外墙和入口没变）</p>
<p><strong>We can see that the new design proposal involves making a number of changes to</strong> the ground floor of the house, mainly in the central hall area. <strong>There are no plans to</strong> change external walls or entrances.</p>
<p><em><strong>Details - 2 paragraphs</strong></em></p>
<p>（右边：大厅消失了，大厅和起居室的内墙消失，楼梯移位，储物间消失）</p>
<p>The most noticeable change from the existing to the proposed floor plan is that there will no longer be a separate hall area when the building work has been done. This will be achieved by removing the internal wall and door between the hall and livingroom, along with the current staircase and under-stair storage cupboard. With no separate hall area, the proposed living room will also contain the staircase to the first floor.</p>
<p>（左边：变双开门+厨房家具）</p>
<p>To replace the current straight staircase, a new set of winding stairs will be installed in the corner of the living room. The internal door between the hall and kitchen will also be replaced with double doors connecting the kitchen with the new living room. Finally, the planned building work will also include the installation of some kitchen furniture.</p>

<p>The two maps below compare a previous layout of a harbor in 2000 with the plan of how it is redesigned currently.</p>
<p>We can see that the changes mainly focus on the buildings, docks and roads.</p>
<p>In the west part of the map, it is clear that the there is a new building for showers and toilets between the former two car park areas. While a new road has been constructed to connect the lower car park to the main road, the small road linking the lower car park to the side road has been removed. Moreover, the former private yachts, namely Marian, and fishing boats have exchanged their locations.</p>
<p>In the east part of the map, an additional dock was added next to the old one. On the northeast side of the land, the former disused castle was altered into a hotel, with a new road branch from the old road to the Lifeboat. Consequently, the public beach transformed to private use for the hotel. What’s more, a new building for cafés and shops was built between the current private yachts and the Lifeboat.</p>

<h3 id="Opinion-essay-do-YOU-agree-or-disagree"><a href="#Opinion-essay-do-YOU-agree-or-disagree" class="headerlink" title="Opinion essay - do YOU agree or disagree"></a>Opinion essay - do YOU agree or disagree</h3><p><em>The <strong>money spent by governments</strong> on <strong>space programmes</strong> would be better spent on <strong>vital public services</strong> such as schools and hospitals. <u>To what extent do you agree or disagree?</u></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Introduction</strong></em></p>
<p>Governments in some countries spend large amounts of money on space &#x3D;&#x3D;exploration&#x3D;&#x3D; programmes. I &#x3D;&#x3D;completely&#x3D;&#x3D; agree that these are a waste of money, and that the &#x3D;&#x3D;funds&#x3D;&#x3D; (money) should be &#x3D;&#x3D;allocated&#x3D;&#x3D; (used) to crucial public services.</p>
<p><em><strong>Why space spending should be stopped</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>There are several reasons why space programmes should be &#x3D;&#x3D;abandoned&#x3D;&#x3D; (stopped).</strong> <strong>Firstly,</strong> it is extremely <strong>expensive</strong> to train space scientists and other staff involved with &#x3D;&#x3D;space missions&#x3D;&#x3D; (space programmes), and facilities and equipment also &#x3D;&#x3D;come at a huge cost&#x3D;&#x3D; (expensive) to the government. **Secondly, **these programmes do not benefit normal people in our daily lives; they are simply &#x3D;&#x3D;<strong>vanity project</strong>s&#x3D;&#x3D; (面子工程) for politicians. **Finally, **many missions to space failed completely, and the &#x3D;&#x3D;smallest technical error&#x3D;&#x3D; can cost astronauts their lives. The Challenger space shuttle disaster showed us that space travel is extremely dangerous, and in my opinion it is not worth the risk.</p>
<p><em><strong>Why public service spending is better</strong></em> </p>
<p><strong>I believe that the money from space programmes should go vital social services instead</strong>. It is much <strong>cheaper</strong> to train doctors, teachers, police and other public service workers than it is to train astronauts or the scientists and engineers who work on space exploration projects. <strong>Furthermore</strong>, public servants do jobs that have a positive impact on &#x3D;&#x3D;every member of society&#x3D;&#x3D; (every). <strong>For example</strong>, we all use schools, hospitals and roads, and we all need the security that the police provide. <strong>If</strong> the governments &#x3D;&#x3D;reallocated&#x3D;&#x3D; the money spent on space travel and research, many thousands of people could &#x3D;&#x3D;be lifted out of poverty&#x3D;&#x3D; (reduce poverty -&gt; lift people out of poverty) or given a better quality of life.</p>
<p><em><strong>conclusion - spend on services that benefit us all</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>In conclusion, my view is that</strong> governments should spend money on services that benefit all members of society, and it is wrong to waste resources on projects that do not improve our everyday lives.</p>

<p><em><strong>The most important aim of science should be to improve people’s lives.</strong></em> </p>
<p><em><strong>To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?</strong></em> </p>
<p>It is widely believed that the primary goal of scientific development should be to enhance the quality of individual lives. I fully agree with this viewpoint, as advancement of sicence and technology should be used to serve humanity and address its needs.</p>
<p>Firstly, The starting point and ultimate destination behand scientific exploration is to improve human welfare. Advances in various fields of science have led to numerous new technological products invented, then put into the market that significantly enhance the standard of living by offerring service and a varitey of choices to consumers. From household appliences to smart devices, these innovations provide convenience, efficiency and a better quality of life for people. Furthermore, breakthroughs in modern medical science, such as the development of vaccines, life-saving surgeries, and advanced treatments, have drastically improved health outcomes. As a result, prople are in longer, healther lives, which highlights how science has directly benefited human well-being.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if scientific progress is not focused on improving lives, it can lead to unintended consequences. For instance, while the discovery of atomic energy was a significant scientific milestone, its application in weapons such as atomic bombs has caused catastrophic destruction. Similarly, technologies such as autonomous vehicles or firearms, if not properly regulated, can lead to accidents and loss of life. These examples demonstrate that when scientific advancements are misused or not properly supervised, they can harm humanity rather than improve it.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that the most important objective of science should be to enhance people’s lives. By focusing on the betterment of human welfare and ensuring the responsible application of scientific discoveries, we can ensure that science continues to serve humanity in positive and meaningful ways.</p>

<p>&#x3D;&#x3D;我的作文&#x3D;&#x3D;</p>
<p><em><strong>The working week should be shorter and workers should have a longer weekend.</strong></em>  </p>
<p><em><strong>Do you agree or disagree?</strong></em> </p>
<p><strong>Nowadays, the topic of working time has emerged as a prominent subject of intensive discussion.</strong> Some people (believe &#x2F; hold a view &#x2F; consider that workweek should be reduced) &#x2F; (deem the reduction of the workweek necessary), allowing employees to enjoy a extended weekend. <strong>In my opinion, I firmly agree with this idea that</strong> workers should have more rest time in a week.</p>
<hr>
<p>&#x3D;&#x3D;<strong>促进社会和谐：（缩短工作时间）—-因此—&gt; （有更多自己的时间享受生活、陪伴家人）—–从而—-&gt;（工人更快乐身心愉悦）—–这种状态下——&gt;（人们普遍不容易和别人发生矛盾）——进而——&gt;（减少犯罪率和社会冲突）—–最终促进—&gt;（社会和谐）</strong>&#x3D;&#x3D;</p>
<p><u>Improving workers’ time for breaks <strong>could</strong> <strong>promote the</strong> <strong>social harmony, which refers to</strong> the peaceful coexistence and mutual support among individuals and communities.</u> </p>
<p><strong>To be more specific</strong>, <strong>when</strong> companies shorten the working time for workers, they <strong>thus</strong> <strong>have more</strong> time to take vacations, spend time with their families and enjoy life. <strong>Consequently</strong>, <strong>they are likely</strong> feel happier and gain a great sense of well-being, <strong>which means</strong> they generally tend to get along better with others rather than experience conflicts. <strong>This</strong> <strong>improvement</strong> in interpersonal relationships <strong>contributes to</strong> <strong>a significant reduction</strong> in social conflicts and crime rates, <strong>ultimately fostering</strong> social harmony.</p>
<hr>
<p>&#x3D;&#x3D;<strong>创造更大经济效益：中心句（提高生产力和效率，为公司创造更高收益）—–For example—-&gt;（英国推行一周4天工作制）：（降低工作时间）—-从而—-&gt;（员工更满意、轻松）——进而—-&gt;（工作时有更多精力）——因此——-&gt;（提高工作效率生产力）—最终促进——&gt;（公司经济效益提升）</strong>&#x3D;&#x3D;</p>
<p><u><strong>From the aspect of efficiency and financial benefit</strong>, employees should curtail work time in order to have better rest and rejuvenation.</u> </p>
<p><strong>For example</strong>, a British company managed to implement a policy guaranteeing employees the right to three-day vacations each week. <strong>After that</strong>, the financial profit of this company improved dramatically. <strong>Undoubtedly</strong>, <strong>with the introduction of</strong> this rest-promising policy, <strong>workers did not have to</strong> spend too much time dealing with work, <strong>which made them feel</strong> less stressed and more satisfied with their employers. <strong>As a result,</strong> they had more energy and focus on their work, <strong>leading to</strong> higher efficiency and greater engagement during working hours. <strong>This improvement in performance</strong> <strong>ultimately contributed to</strong> better productivity and, <strong>thus</strong>, a higher economic profit for the entire company compared to previous extended working hours.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>In conclusion, I am resolute in my belief that</strong> working week should be shortened, allowing workers to enjoy a longer weekend.</p>
